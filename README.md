### Contributers

### Project Information and Documentation

Sven and I, are students in a Cantonal School in Switzerland. 
In one of our classes we were given one semester to develop any Project we liked, as long as if fulfilled the following criteria:

  * It had to be written mainly in Java
  * The Design had to be made with the Swing Designer
  * As IDE we had to use eclipse
  * Something had to be saved to the harddrive when using the app (e.g. music files)

We decided to code a game since we both have never done that before. We then settled on implementing our very own version of the famous "Snake"-game for this project.

<br/>

We have written an in-depth project documentation (in german) which can be found <a href="https://github.com/Manuel-Schmid/Snakeology/blob/master/src/Snakeology_project-documentation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
<br/>

### Achievements

The project was evaluated and we achieved a grade of 6 (which is the best possible grade in swiss schools).
We were very happy about that result and we had a fun time coding and planning the project, we built a lot of extra-features because we really enjoied implementing them. :)
